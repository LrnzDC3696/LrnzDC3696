# Hi there, I'm a monkeybrain with a deadbrain ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 17 yrs old coder who started coding at January 2021.
I haven been coding on a smartphone since I started.
I did it to fuel my interest and love for coding.
And also because I didn't have a laptop ðŸ˜”.
Even though it was just pure pain, I still made all
my projects of my projects just to gain experience
And knowledge.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning `html and css`.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on `any web project`.
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking for `help with understanding concepts`.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: `monki`
