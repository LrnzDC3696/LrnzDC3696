# Hi there, I'm a monkeybrain with a deadbrain ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 17 yrs old coder who started coding at January 2021.
I have been coding on a smartphone since I started.
I did it to fuel my interest and love for coding.
And also because I didn't have a laptop ðŸ˜”.
Even though it was just pure pain, I still made all
my projects of my projects just to gain experience
And knowledge.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on `web development stuff`.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning `html and css`.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on `any web project`.
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking for `help with understanding concepts`.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about `how I learn fast`.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: `email or discord`
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: `monki`
- ðŸ˜Ž Fun fact: `When I'm in the right mood I'll never give you up`
- ðŸŒŸ Wish: `Get hired even though while I'm still below 20 yrs old`
